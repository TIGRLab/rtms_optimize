## Construction of simNIBS optimized mesh geometry and comparison to fs_LR_32k

#### Objective:
Establish a correspondence between the individualized functional network parcellation embedded in **fs_LR_32k** space and the optimized mesh generated by the simNIBS re-meshing algorithm.  

#### Requirements:
Since we're modelling the grey matter and the volumetric mesh contains representations for different tissue types, we don't just want a surface projection but a **surface to discrete volume projection**, since this will better model the regions that we want to stimulate since it will have finite volume.
