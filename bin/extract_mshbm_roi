# Helper script to extract a spatially-contiguous ROI from the Yeo17 MS-HBM parcellation scheme
# INPUTS:
# (1) an ROI metric in fs_LR_32k space derived from spatial priors (.shape.gii)
# (2) an input MS-HBM parcellation .shape.gii
# (3) the output file in which to store the spatial clustering
# (4) The network key of interest (use wb_command -file-information on MS-HBM)
#
# WORKFLOW:
# (1) Extract the network of interest from MS-HBM parcellation
# (2) Apply spatial clustering 
# (3) Compute intersection between spatial prior ROI and spatially clustered MS-HBM
# (4) Compute the MODE of the region entrapped in the intersection between the two maps
#
# OUTPUT:
# File containing spatially contiguous mask that most overlaps with selected ROI from spatial prior
#
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# The assumption is that since MS-HBM is biased by the spatial prior
# The intersection between the spatial prior and MS-HBM parcellation will likely yield the corresponding ROI
# since spatial distributions of ROIs are derived from the spatial prior
# You should verify the outputs of this script since this behaviour is not guaranteed!
